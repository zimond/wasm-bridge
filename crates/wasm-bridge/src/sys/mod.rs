/// A compiled WebAssembly module, ready to be instantiated.
///
/// A `Module` is a compiled in-memory representation of an input WebAssembly
/// binary. A `Module` is then used to create an [`Instance`](crate::Instance)
/// through an instantiation process. You cannot call functions or fetch
/// globals, for example, on a `Module` because it's purely a code
/// representation. Instead you'll need to create an
/// [`Instance`](crate::Instance) to interact with the wasm module.
///
/// A `Module` can be created by compiling WebAssembly code through APIs such as
/// [`Module::new`]. This would be a JIT-style use case where code is compiled
/// just before it's used. Alternatively a `Module` can be compiled in one
/// process and [`Module::serialize`] can be used to save it to storage. A later
/// call to [`Module::deserialize`] will quickly load the module to execute and
/// does not need to compile any code, representing a more AOT-style use case.
///
/// Currently a `Module` does not implement any form of tiering or dynamic
/// optimization of compiled code. Creation of a `Module` via [`Module::new`] or
/// related APIs will perform the entire compilation step synchronously. When
/// finished no further compilation will happen at runtime or later during
/// execution of WebAssembly instances for example.
///
/// Compilation of WebAssembly by default goes through Cranelift and is
/// recommended to be done once-per-module. The same WebAssembly binary need not
/// be compiled multiple times and can instead used an embedder-cached result of
/// the first call.
///
/// `Module` is thread-safe and safe to share across threads.
///
/// ## Modules and `Clone`
///
/// Using `clone` on a `Module` is a cheap operation. It will not create an
/// entirely new module, but rather just a new reference to the existing module.
/// In other words it's a shallow copy, not a deep copy.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// There are a number of ways you can create a `Module`, for example pulling
/// the bytes from a number of locations. One example is loading a module from
/// the filesystem:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use wasmtime::*;
/// # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
/// let engine = Engine::default();
/// let module = Module::from_file(&engine, "path/to/foo.wasm")?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// You can also load the wasm text format if more convenient too:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use wasmtime::*;
/// # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
/// let engine = Engine::default();
/// // Now we're using the WebAssembly text extension: `.wat`!
/// let module = Module::from_file(&engine, "path/to/foo.wat")?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// And if you've already got the bytes in-memory you can use the
/// [`Module::new`] constructor:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use wasmtime::*;
/// # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
/// let engine = Engine::default();
/// # let wasm_bytes: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
/// let module = Module::new(&engine, &wasm_bytes)?;
///
/// // It also works with the text format!
/// let module = Module::new(&engine, "(module (func))")?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Serializing and deserializing a module looks like:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use wasmtime::*;
/// # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
/// let engine = Engine::default();
/// # let wasm_bytes: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
/// let module = Module::new(&engine, &wasm_bytes)?;
/// let module_bytes = module.serialize()?;
///
/// // ... can save `module_bytes` to disk or other storage ...
///
/// // recreate the module from the serialized bytes. For the `unsafe` bits
/// // see the documentation of `deserialize`.
/// let module = unsafe { Module::deserialize(&engine, &module_bytes)? };
/// # Ok(())
/// # }

/// Structure used to link wasm modules/instances together.
///
/// This structure is used to assist in instantiating a [`Module`]. A [`Linker`]
/// is a way of performing name resolution to make instantiating a module easier
/// than specifying positional imports to [`Instance::new`]. [`Linker`] is a
/// name-based resolver where names are dynamically defined and then used to
/// instantiate a [`Module`].
///
/// An important method is [`Linker::instantiate`] which takes a module to
/// instantiate into the provided store. This method will automatically select
/// all the right imports for the [`Module`] to be instantiated, and will
/// otherwise return an error if an import isn't satisfied.
///
/// ## Name Resolution
///
/// As mentioned previously, `Linker` is a form of name resolver. It will be
/// using the string-based names of imports on a module to attempt to select a
/// matching item to hook up to it. This name resolution has two-levels of
/// namespaces, a module level and a name level. Each item is defined within a
/// module and then has its own name. This basically follows the wasm standard
/// for modularization.
///
/// Names in a `Linker` cannot be defined twice, but allowing duplicates by
/// shadowing the previous definition can be controlled with the
/// [`Linker::allow_shadowing`] method.
///
/// ## Commands and Reactors
///
/// The [`Linker`] type provides conveniences for working with WASI Commands and
/// Reactors through the [`Linker::module`] method. This will automatically
/// handle instantiation and calling `_start` and such as appropriate
/// depending on the inferred type of module.
///
/// ## Type parameter `T`
///
/// It's worth pointing out that the type parameter `T` on [`Linker<T>`] does
/// not represent that `T` is stored within a [`Linker`]. Rather the `T` is used
/// to ensure that linker-defined functions and stores instantiated into all use
/// the same matching `T` as host state.
///
/// ## Multiple `Store`s
///
/// The [`Linker`] type is designed to be compatible, in some scenarios, with
/// instantiation in multiple [`Store`]s. Specifically host-defined functions
/// created in [`Linker`] with [`Linker::func_new`], [`Linker::func_wrap`], and
/// their async versions are compatible to instantiate into any [`Store`]. This
/// enables programs which want to instantiate lots of modules to create one
/// [`Linker`] value at program start up and use that continuously for each
/// [`Store`] created over the lifetime of the program.
///
/// Note that once [`Store`]-owned items, such as [`Global`], are defined witin
/// a [`Linker`] then it is no longer compatible with any [`Store`]. At that
/// point only the [`Store`] that owns the [`Global`] can be used to instantiate
/// modules.
///
/// ## Multiple `Engine`s
///
/// The [`Linker`] type is not compatible with usage between multiple [`Engine`]
/// values. An [`Engine`] is provided when a [`Linker`] is created and only
/// stores and items which originate from that [`Engine`] can be used with this
/// [`Linker`]. If more than one [`Engine`] is used with a [`Linker`] then that
/// may cause a panic at runtime, similar to how if a [`Func`] is used with the
/// wrong [`Store`] that can also panic at runtime.

    /// code compiled from a WebAssembly binary originally. This is the analog of
    /// [`Module`](crate::Module) in the component embedding API.

    /// A [`Component`] can be turned into an
    /// [`Instance`](crate::component::Instance) through a
    /// [`Linker`](crate::component::Linker). [`Component`]s are safe to share
    /// across threads. The compilation model of a component is the same as that of
    /// [a module](crate::Module) which is to say:
    ///
    /// * Compilation happens synchronously during [`Component::new`].
    /// * The result of compilation can be saved into storage with
    ///   [`Component::serialize`].
    /// * A previously compiled artifact can be parsed with
    ///   [`Component::deserialize`].
    /// * No compilation happens at runtime for a component — everything is done
    ///   by the time [`Component::new`] returns.
    ///
    /// ## Components and `Clone`
    ///
    /// Using `clone` on a `Component` is a cheap operation. It will not create an
    /// entirely new component, but rather just a new reference to the existing
    /// component. In other words it's a shallow copy, not a deep copy.

    ///
    /// * `wasi:cli/stdout@0.2.0`
    /// * `wasi:http/types@0.2.0-rc-2023-10-25`
    /// * `my:custom/plugin@1.0.0-pre.2`
    ///
    /// These version strings are taken into account when looking up names within a
    /// [`Linker`]. You're allowed to define any number of versions within a
    /// [`Linker`] still, for example you can define `a:b/c@0.2.0`, `a:b/c@0.2.1`,
    /// and `a:b/c@0.3.0` all at the same time.
    ///
    /// Specifically though when names are looked up within a linker, for example
    /// during instantiation, semver-compatible names are automatically consulted.
    /// This means that if you define `a:b/c@0.2.1` in a [`Linker`] but a component
    /// imports `a:b/c@0.2.0` then that import will resolve to the `0.2.1` version.
    ///
    /// This lookup behavior relies on hosts being well-behaved when using Semver,
    /// specifically that interfaces once defined are never changed. This reflects
    /// how Semver works at the Component Model layer, and it's assumed that if
    /// versions are present then hosts are respecting this.
    ///
    /// Note that this behavior goes the other direction, too. If a component
    /// imports `a:b/c@0.2.1` and the host has provided `a:b/c@0.2.0` then that
    /// will also resolve correctly. This is because if an API was defined at 0.2.0
    /// and 0.2.1 then it must be the same API.
    ///
